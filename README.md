# Simple Python Project Template

I always strugle with starting new Python projects properly. There is an awesome project called DevAssistant which helps, but I am too lazy to learn how to write my own assistants, thus I created this - a template and a script to bootstrap my projects.

Run 

```
./prep.sh cool_project /path/where/my/cool/project/will/live
cd /path/where/my/cool/project/will/live
python cool_project/cli/main.py verb "Say something"
```

and you should see

```
Running app a2n in version 0.1.
 You said Say something
```

In that case, you are good to go and the only thing I can say is: **Happy Hacking!**

P.S.: I'd like to transform this to an assistant one day. I mean it! Really!
